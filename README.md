# Software Development Estimation Tool

A React app I created to estimate my Software Development gigs. Heads up that I don't use this tool anymore, I've moved to Notion for all my project management tools, so this repo isn't maintained anymore, but feel free to use it yourself if you like!

## Installation and running the app

1. `git clone https://github.com/imjuangarcia/software-development-estimate-tool/`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run start`
